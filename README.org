* Code from my Clojure intro presentation to Asheville.rb on 3/27/2012

  The source for the presentation is in =avl-rb-clojure-intro.org=, and
  I used [[https://github.com/relevance/org-html-slideshow][org-html-slideshow]] to turn it into a presentation. You can
  view the presentation [[http://tcrawley.org/presentations/avl-rb-clojure-intro/][here]] (press 't' to enter presentation mode, and
  use the left and right arrow keys to navigate).

  The simple java graphics demo is in =demo/=.
